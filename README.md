### Critical Role episode summarization.

## Explanation

Dungeons&Dragons is a tabletop role-playing game in which player assume the
role of, usually, one character (PC). PCs have social interactions,
battle, and explore the world as presented by the dungeon master (DM). The
DM plays all non-PC characters (NPCs) and acts as a narrator by describing
all aspects of the world and the inner minds of PCs and NPCs.

Critical Role is a live-streaming show on Twitch in which a core cast of
players, the DM and occasional guests play long-running and shorter-form
Dungeons&Dragons games. It has become very popular (boasting the highest
revenue of all Twitch streams) and the fan base has made available
transcripts and summaries of episodes.
